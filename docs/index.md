# GRIDmas Tree
The GRIDmas Tree is a fully programmable christmas tree with 1000 RGB LEDs. Each LED has a 3D coordinate and can be individually addressed which allows you to create patterns or animations which run in 3D space.

The GRIDmas Tree was originally based on Standup Maths' 500 LED christmas tree. [Watch his video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvlpIojusBE). This project builds upon this foundation with a fully featured API and web-editor to allow for easy modification and testing of patterns.

The GRIDmas tree was created by Ciaran Cook in 2023 as a personal project, and in 2024 started a competition at Heriot Watt University. This year, there is a new API for the tree. You will find everything you need in this documentation site to make great patterns. Documentation for the project has been a joint effort between Cairan and Owen.

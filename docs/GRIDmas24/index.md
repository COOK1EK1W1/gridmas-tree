## 1st Place — **3D Vector Cube**

A beautifully rendered rotating cube in 3D space.  
This entry made seriously clever use of vector math and spatial transforms to produce a stable and very clean visual animation.
I've been told there are even secret messages hidden in the pattern for you to decipher.

## 2nd Place — **Pick Apples**

A wholesome interactive sequence that told the story of apples being picked from the top of the tree and carefully placed at the bottom.  
Charming, creative, and technically sound!

## 3rd Place — **Christmas Helix**

A festive DNA-like helix spiralling upward through the tree.  
Smooth timing, great use of space, and very *very* Christmas-core.

# Gridmas tree
this is a project based on Standup Maths' 500 LED christmas tree https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvlpIojusBE

# running
## prerequisites
pythom installed
### install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements` - this is a bit sketchy as I haven't added the right modules yet
### christmas tree
500 LED christmas tree optional, there is a simulator which should run (also a bit sketchy, it works on my machine)

## run the program
from the `/backend` directory run `sudo python main.py` which will start the webserver and the tree simulator, you can then access the webserver to change pattersn
